EXAMPLE SCENES________________________________________________
1. Intro, waking up in middle of night

    You wake up in bed. It's dark. Thunder claps in the distance and the light patter of rain on the window.
        -Get out of bed ~ You throw away the duvet and swivel sideways to get out of bed. you step forward and kick an object on the ground
        -look around ~ you struggle to see anything
        -look at object ~ The room is dark and you can barely make out a smallish rectangular sillouhette.
        -find lights ~ you fumble in the dark for your reading light. There it is!
        -turn on lights ~ the incessant buzz of illumination prods your ears and your room glows a dim yellow.
